# COVID-19-Data-Analysis
Insights into the pandemic's patterns and the effectiveness of data analysis in public health

This repository showcases our analysis of COVID-19 data for the "Programming Languages for Data Analysis" course. I focused on predicting daily case trends, classifying changes in case counts, and clustering Chinese cities by COVID-19 case numbers and geographical coordinates. Employing linear and Lasso regression models, I predicted future cases based on past data. Additionally, I used logistic regression for classifying case trends and k-means clustering to group cities, offering insights into the pandemic's spread.
